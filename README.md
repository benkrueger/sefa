# SeFa
Selenium Finite Automata!
Finite Automata For selenium tasks

## Preface

UI Testing Automation is tedious, error prone and overall a pain. The selenium framework does a good job of
providing low level functionality to interacting with a web browser programmatically, but the actual implementation
of those tests remains tricky. Until now. Now, defining web UI automation is as easy as drawing a UML diagram!

## Features
- Define any selenium interaction as a UML state machine!
- Save state machine as JSON
- Collect screenshots at every step!
- Use any existing selenium driver, remote or not!
- Visual Regression testing!
- Interactive test generation!
